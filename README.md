# Automating the Bechdel Test
Developing a classifier to automatically predict whether a movie passes the Bechdel Test.

## The Bechdel Test
A movie passes the Bechdel Test if:
  1. it has at least two women in it,
  2. who talk to each other, 
  3. about something besides a man.
  
The test was popularized by Allison Bechdel's 1985 comic Dykes to Watch Out For. Of the 7656 movies added on https://bechdeltest.com, 4427 (57.8%) pass all three tests, 766 (10.0%) pass two tests, 1674 (21.9%) pass one test and 789 (10.3%) pass no tests at all.

## Screenplays
We are using screenplays from Agarwal et al. (2015) and Gorinski and Lapata (2015). Combined, we have 727 screenplays that have Bechdel ratings from bechdeltest.com. 349 (48.0%) pass all three tests, 103 (14.2%) pass two tests, 222 (30.5%) pass one test, and 53 (7.3%) pass no tests.
